# Geostrategic | World 00

[Geostrategic](https://geostrategic.particlesystem.com) is a large-scale
massively-multiplayer online (MMO) real-time strategy (RTS) sandbox game.

This repository contains the source code for World 00 â€” the first in the series
of Geostrategic worlds. This world is intended to be a prototype for developing
the basic game mechanics.

## Development Process

Development is done using a documentation-first approach in which changes are
made to the docs before being implemented in the game. This gives a chance for
the community to propose, review and discuss changes without needing to
understand the codebase in detail. All work is managed via [a GitHub
project](https://github.com/users/haydn/projects/1).

If you'd like to contribute to the development of this world, there are a number
of ways you can get involved:

1. Report bugs and request features via the [issue
   tracker](https://github.com/haydn/geostrategic-w00/issues).
2. Contribute change to the docs for [issues that need
   documenting](https://github.com/users/haydn/projects/1/views/2) via
   [pull-requests](https://github.com/haydn/geostrategic-w00/pulls).
3. Contribute changes to the game for [issues that need
   implementing](https://github.com/users/haydn/projects/1/views/3) via
   [pull-requests](https://github.com/haydn/geostrategic-w00/pulls).
